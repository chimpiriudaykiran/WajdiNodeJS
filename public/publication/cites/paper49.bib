ABSTRACT = {Distance learning has grown rapidly in recent years. E-learning can aid teachers of students with disabilities, particularly visually impaired students (VISs), by offering versatility, accessibility, enhanced communication, adaptability, and a wide range of multimedia and non-verbal teaching methods. However, the shift from traditional face-to-face instruction to online platforms, especially during the pandemic, introduced unique challenges for VISs, with respect to including instructional methodologies, accessibility, and the integration of suitable technology. Recent research has shown that the resources and facilities of educational institutions pose challenges for teachers of visually impaired students (TVISs). This study conducts a literature review of research studies from the years 2000 to 2024 to identify significant issues encountered by TVISs with online learning to show the effects of distance learning before, during, and after the pandemic. This systematic literature review examines 25 publications. The evaluation reveals technological problems affecting the educational experience of visually impaired educators through a methodical categorization and analysis of these papers. The results emphasize important problems and suggest solutions, providing valuable knowledge for experts in education and legislation. The study recommends technology solutions to support instructors in providing inclusive online learning environments for VISs.},
