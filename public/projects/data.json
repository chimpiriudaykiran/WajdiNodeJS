    "title": "Software Unit Test Smells",
    "description": "Unit test code, just like regular/production source code, is subject to bad programming practices, also known as anti-patterns, defects, and smells. Smells, being symptoms of bad design or implementation decisions, have been proven to decrease the quality of software systems from various aspects, such as making it harder to understand, more complex to maintain, and more prone to errors  and bugs.",

      {
        "": "Test smells are defined as bad programming practices in unit test code (such as how test cases are organized, implemented, and interact with each other) that indicate potential design problems in the test source code.",
        "": "This project aims to educate developers on the types of unit testing smells that developers typically introduce or encounter when writing unit tests. To this extent, this project seeks to extend the existing test smell catalog by adding new types of test smells. Additionally, we make available an open-source tool to detect the different smell types in the source code.",
        "Stakeholder Engagement": "Engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders—including technology developers, legal experts, ethicists, and end-users—is crucial for the development of realistic and effective AI policies. This collaborative approach ensures that diverse perspectives are considered, making the policies more robust and widely acceptable.",
        "Implementation Strategies": "Develop practical implementation strategies for AI policies in mobile apps, including tools and frameworks that assist developers in adhering to these policies. Regular audits, user feedback mechanisms, and continuous policy updates are planned to adapt to technological advancements and changing regulatory landscapes."
